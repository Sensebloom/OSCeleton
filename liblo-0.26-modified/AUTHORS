Guidelines for authors:

As liblo is an implementation of a fairly widespread protocol I'd like to keep
any changes in check to try to prevent it deviating too far from the agreed OSC
standard and the intended niche of liblo (ie. easy to use). To help that,
please try to follow the following guidelines:

* Keep to the current, fairly minimal, OO-C API style where possible
* Document any API changes in Doxygen style. my current docs aren't great, but
  the're better than nothing :)
* Update the ChangeLog whenever neccesary.
* Add tests for any changes or discovered bugs to the regression test file.
