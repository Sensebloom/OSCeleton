2009-03-07: Release 0.26
--------------------------------------------

We are pleased to present stable release 0.26 of LibLo, the
lightweight, easy to use implementation of the Open Sound Control
protocol.

Open Sound Control (OSC) is a protocol for communication among
computers, sound synthesizers, and other multimedia devices that is
designed for use over modern network transports.

This release marks the first release of LibLo under the LGPL license
version 2.1 or later, allowing the use of LibLo in non-GPL
applications as long as it is dynamically linked such that the LibLo
portion of the application can remain freely modifiable.  We hope that
this will allow compatibility with a wider variety of audio
applications and encourage the use of open protocols even in
commercial software.  (This change was motivated by receiving a number
of requests for special permission for the use of LibLo in non-GPL
software.)

This release also introduces some new features, such as the ability to
use custom transports, proper TCP multi-session support, access to
bundle timestamp information, and wider C compiler compatibility.

Details:
- Change license to LGPL 2.1 or later.
- Add return codes to all functions that may fail.
- Fix memory leaks in lo_address_new_from_url(), dispatch_method(),
  lo_url_get_path()
- Move lo_arg_size(), lo_get_path(), lo_arg_host/network_endian() back
  to lo_lowlevel.h.
- Expose the lo_server_dispatch_data() function as public, making it
  possible to react to messages contained in an arbitrary block of
  memory.  (i.e., allows use with custom transport protocols)
- Get protocol by ID number.
- Keep TCP sessions open, and automatically track multiple open
  sessions in a data structure.
- Allow access to bundle timestamp information.
- Fix bug in lo_timetag_diff().
- Change the value of LO_TT_IMMEDIATE to correspond with the OSC
  specification.
- Enable SO_REUSEPORT when initializing a multicast server.
- Update the "soname" describing API/ABI compatibility.
- Update documentation and various bug fixes.
- Compiles under MSVC, avoiding the use of gcc-isms when not using
  gcc.

--------------------------------------------

About:
LibLO is a lightweight library for handling the sending and receiving of
messages according to the Open Sound Control (OSC) protocol on POSIX
systems. 

Changes:
lo_server_get_protocol() and lo_address_get_protocol() were added. Tests
for lo_address_get_* were added to the test tool. Several compiler
warnings were fixed. The address for package bug reports was changed.
lo_blob_new() was changed to take const void*. The getnameinfo() method of
getting hostname is disabled when IPv6 is disabled. A Unix server socket is
now unlinked when it is closed. The size of a Unix socket path is checked
properly.
